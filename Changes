           (RT73665)

0.10    CHANGES:
         * Use XSLoader instead of DynaLoader
         * import Exporter::import instead of @ISAing it

         * Varions small updates to keep CPANTS happy

0.08    BUGFIXES:
         * Fix off-by-one error when removing an fd which causes an
           uninitialised pollfd element to enter the set instead
         * Use dedicated pipe in test script rather than STDIN/STDOUT, which
           the containing test system may have altered in ways that make our
           test fail

           it

         * Make sure that ->poll( undef ) works and doesn't throw a warning

0.02    BUGFIXES:
         * Don't upset perl 5.6.2's POSIX::sigprocmask() by passing 'undef'
           as oldsigmask

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
